# Deepfake Detection in Medical Images Using VAE-GAN with PSO

##  Overview
This project implements a **Variational Autoencoder â€“ Generative Adversarial Network (VAE-GAN)** framework with **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** for detecting manipulated (deepfake) medical images.

- **VAE**: Encodes and reconstructs medical images, ensuring feature consistency.
- **GAN Discriminator**: Learns to distinguish real from fake images for improved detection.
- **Classification Head**: Predicts real vs fake labels directly from latent space.
- **PSO**: Optimizes hyperparameters such as learning rate, latent size, and convolutional filters.

The framework achieves **high detection accuracy** on medical deepfake datasets, outperforming CNN baselines.
